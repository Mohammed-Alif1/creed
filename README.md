**Creed Team 15**

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement
The **Geospatial Coordinate Converter** tackles the challenge of converting and visualizing geospatial coordinates effortlessly. This tool supports:
- 📍 **Individual Inputs**: Latitude and longitude coordinates.
- 📄 **Bulk Inputs**: Uploading and processing CSV files.
- 🗺️ **Visualization**: Outputs displayed on a map for easy understanding.
- 📂 **Downloadable Results**: Converted data can be downloaded as CSV.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Input Options**:
  - ✏️ Enter individual coordinates manually.
  - 📁 Upload CSV files for bulk processing.
- **Output**:
  - 📥 Download converted CSV file.
  - 📌 Visualize coordinates on an interactive map.
- **Deployment**:
  - 🔧 Built using Streamlit for user-friendly interaction.
- **Additional Tools**:
  - 🛠️ **Raw Code Checking**: Use `gcc-raw.py` to check the functionality of the code without the interface.
  - ➗ **Formula Verification**: Use `gccc-formla.py` to analyze the formula used for geospatial conversions.
